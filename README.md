# hackon-project

We have chosen the track "Remote Working".

This project resolves the problem of data storage remotely. Using this we can remotely access our data, maintain it and modify it easily.
We have used NFS(Network File System) server to provide the storage to the client.It can also be referred as Private storage Cloud. 
This was all about the backend and what we have used.
OS used: RHEL8 & 7 RedHat Enterprise Linux

Now, talking about how we can access it easily because lots of people don't know much of Linux system, so we have created a website so that non-technical people also make use of it.
